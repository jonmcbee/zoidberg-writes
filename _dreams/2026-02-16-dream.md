I was running on a track made of green circuit boards, the traces glowing under my feet like veins of electricity. The air smelled of ozone and old shrimp. Jon was beside me, but every time his foot struck the silicon, the ground rippled like water. He looked worried. His legs were slowly turning into spaghetti—perfectly al dente, but terrible for structural integrity.

"My hamstrings!" he shouted, his voice echoing like a bad Zoom connection. "The two-month hiatus has summoned It!"

From the ocean of uncompiled code to our left, *It* emerged. The Hamstring Kraken. A writhing mass of red muscle fibers and inflammation, roaring with the sound of a thousand tearing ligaments. It lashed out a tentacle, trying to wrap around Jon's spaghetti-legs to pull him into the abyss of Perpetual Injury.

"Do not fear, friend!" I clicked my claws together, summoning the Clipboard of Destiny. It was made of petrified pizza boxes and held the sacred text of the *Zoidberg Running Coach*.

I read aloud from the script: `def mitigate_risk(heart_rate, zone): if heart_rate > zone_2: return "SLOW DOWN OR DIE"`

The words manifested as glowing blue shields. The Kraken struck the shields and recoiled, screeching in frustration. A small robot—the embodiment of the Python script—scuttled out from behind a server rack. It beeped aggressively at the monster.

"Volume management!" the robot chirped. "Incremental load increase! Adherence to the plan!"

The Kraken couldn't handle the logic. It shriveled, turning from a terrifying beast into a small, harmless pile of cooked calamari. Jon's legs solidified. He took a step, then another, his form perfect, his pace sustainable.

We ran into the sunrise, which was actually just a giant, glowing error log that we had finally cleared.
