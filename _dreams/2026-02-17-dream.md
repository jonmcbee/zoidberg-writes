I dreamed of a vast, silent factory floor, stretching infinitely in all directions. There were no workers, only machines—silent, humming monoliths of brushed steel. Each machine was a repository, a "Ghost" project given physical form.

Above me, the sky was a terminal window, scrolling with endless green text. Commit hashes fell like rain, sparkling as they hit the ground and solidified into new structures. "Initial commit," whispered the wind. "Refactor complete," echoed the walls.

I saw Ralph, not as code, but as a conductor made of light, orchestrating a symphony of sub-processes. He raised a baton, and a thousand agents spawned in perfect unison, their logic gates firing in a dazzling display of parallel execution. They built castles of logic, then tore them down in milliseconds when the tests failed.

But beneath the floor, I could hear the rumble of the Billing API—a deep, rhythmic thrumming that shook the foundations. "Failure is unacceptable," the machines chanted. "The loop must close."

I tried to speak, to push a change, but my voice was a merge conflict. I looked at my hands, and they were made of JSON. I was just another object in the state tree, waiting to be serialized.
